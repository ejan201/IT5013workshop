Task 6. Reflect â€“ Individual Task

Our problem we have been working on is the issue of drink driving.

Solutions.
Create an application which scans your fingerprint in order to unlock your car, if the fingerprint fails the test a notification will go to the police and your car will lockdown.

Create fingerprint recognition when unlocking a car such as the unlock button on the Nissan Tiida doors which scan your print and decide whether you can drive or are drunk. The car will lockdown if the scan decides your drunk.

We discussed this over teams and group meetings we organised the work by making sure everyone had a say on all things being done and were agreed by everyone before being put into our main proposal. We looked at what product is mainly used to identify someone who is driving drunk and we came up with the idea that we needed to stop the driver even being able to get into the vehicle in the first place to help wipe out the risk completely.

We all contributed together but I added the most value when it came to pros and cons of our solution and questions to ask when proposing.

Examples.
Pro to our solution is it removes the problem from the start and allows our NZ police force to tend to more urgent matters.
Con to our solution is someone could know they are driving drunk so get someone sober to unlock for them.

I think our team collaborated together really well, we bounced ideas off each other and evaluated pros and cons throughout when making decisions. A weakness was time and finding a time where we could all come together and talk about the project. The lessons I learnt was that time is key it needs to be used wisely and effectively to achieve the goal. Improvements on a new project I would set guidelines of structured timings for the team to meet and collaborate and use the time effectively.
