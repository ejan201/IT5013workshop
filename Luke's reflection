Issue selected: Drink driving

Developed the idea for an application with main priority to lockdown a car when a person is thought to be intoxicated and notify police for smoother communication.

We tried coming up with ideas that would be new and improved, came up with the idea of fingerprint technology being implemented to lock the vehicle and not allow said intoxicated person to operate under the influence. Not only that but a notification system that will alert the police if said person has been locked out and number of attempts etc. 

Most of the ideas were constructed in person because our whole team is only at campus on Thursday evenings, we communicated over teams and personal phones to continue the contribution of ideas. Also, we have put all this information in a repository on Github with our sections of tasks and contributions so we are all on the same page.

I believe I brought value to the market validation getting down the foundation of the questions and getting a structure in place that allowed the group to contribute and get the task done.

Overall, we actually worked really well together there was a continuous stream of ideas that were all relevant and complimented everyone elseâ€™s, we are all very like-minded and that helped when it comes to constructing ideas. This task helped rejog my brain when it comes to group work and creating a plan as well as a process when in a group. For next time I think specific set times to work on the process would help, either through teams of just contributing on Github from home.
